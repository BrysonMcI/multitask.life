# multitaskLife
From basic todo apps to GTD mantra focused beasts we weren't pleased with the current options. They all seemed to miss out on some feature or another and there wasn't an option that checked all the boxes. So we set out to create multitaskLife.
## Current Features
* None. We just started development!
## Planned Features
* Completely Cross Platform: Web, Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android, iOS.
* Offline Support: on each app, so you don't need to be attached to the internet.
* Security: 2FA, Encryption all around, and no data leakage.
* Life Sperators: Because you don't want to see your work life at home.
* Flexible Views: Switch between lists, kanbans, calendars, and more at ease.
* Start Times & Due Dates: You'll always get your work done on time, and not be distracted on work you don't need to do yet.
* Custom Filters: Filter and sort based on what you want to see, not what we think you want to see.
* Endless Nesting: Because sometimes those tasks, have subtasks, which have subtasks, which can further be broken out.
* Graphs and Reflections: We just want you to feel good about what you got done and see what's next
* Collaboration: Share lists with family, friends, or make a team at work (with real permission settings) and special collaboration features.
* Daily Planning: Give us the data (priority, estimated time, your schedule) and we can help you optimize your time.
* Fancy Reminders: Time, location and weather based + whatever else we can think of.
